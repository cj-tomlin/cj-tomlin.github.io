# Portfolio & Blog Project Requirements

## Overview
Create a simple, modern portfolio and blog site using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and Starwind UI. The primary focus is on a clean, centered index page that adapts to both mobile and desktop, with a programmatically populated project section using markdown files.

## Goals
- Showcase personal projects in a visually appealing, responsive layout.
- Provide a blog section for future posts.
- Use modern, maintainable, and scalable tools and best practices.

## Features
1. **Index Page**
   - Centered single-column layout.
   - Top padding for visual separation.
   - Navigation bar with only the user's name, linking to the index page.
   - Introductory text (a few sentences).
   - Prominent "View Blog Posts" button (using Starwind UI Button).
   - Projects section, populated programmatically from markdown files.

2. **Projects Section**
   - Each project is defined in a markdown file with frontmatter (title, description, link, tags).
   - Projects are rendered in a list/grid on the index page.
   - Easy to add/edit projects by updating markdown files.

3. **Blog (Future Scope)**
   - Placeholder for blog posts (can be a simple link for now).
   - Blog posts to be added later, using markdown or MDX.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Astro (latest version)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Starwind UI (primarily Button)
- **Content:** Markdown files for projects (optionally MDX in the future)

## Best Practices
- Use Astro layouts for consistent structure.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling and responsiveness.
- Fetch and render markdown content programmatically (Astro.glob or content collections).
- Keep code modular and maintainable.

## Folder Structure (Suggested)
- `src/pages/index.astro` – Main landing page
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` – Shared layout
- `src/content/projects/` – Markdown files for each project
- `src/components/` – Reusable components (e.g., ProjectCard, Navbar)

## Out of Scope
- Blog post implementation (for now)
- Advanced interactivity or authentication
